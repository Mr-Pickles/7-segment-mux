# 7-segment-mux
Multiplexing 2 7-segment LEDs using a Raspberry Pico

The 2 digit seven segment display I used for this was an TG320of I had lying around.  Details of this can be found at http://www.voti.nl/docs/disp-7.pdf for the pin outs.

The schematic shows a 7-segment LED that has a decimal point - my TG302of does not so that is not connected up on the schematic.
